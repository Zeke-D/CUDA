# CUDA

## Introduction
In this assignment, we will get more experience writing programs that utilize our CUDA-enabled GPU. Additionally, we'll perform a small case study that looks at the resulting performance of GPUs vs. CPUs for certain types of programs. 

This assignment will cover:
* Calls to the kernel
* Vector Addition
* Matrix Addition

## Assignment
There are three parts to this assignment:
* [Part 1](./multiply)
* [Part 2](./vector_add)
* [Part 3](./matrix_add)
