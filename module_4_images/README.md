# Image Processing
## Introduction
In Module 3, we studied the different ways we could decrypt messages encrypted with the Caesar and Affine cipher. In this module, we'll take a look at steganography--the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, public file to avoid detection. We'll explore this approach through hiding messages within images, and using CUDA to encrypt and decrypt such messages.

This assignment will cover:
* Image processing basics
* Steganography with images

## Assignment
There are two parts to this assignmnt:
* [Part 1](./filters/README.md) -- Fun with Filters
* [Part 2](./steganography/README.md) -- Image Steganography 

## Module Learning Objectives
* Write CUDA kernels that implement different filters of an image
* Use PPM format to store/modify images
* Encode and decode messages stored as pixel values within each image
* Performing bitwise operations to manipulate data
