# Ciphers Revisited
## Introduction
In this module, we will revisit some of the ciphers we saw in module 1. However, now armed with CUDA, we'll see how we can parallelize our programs to make them even faster.

This assignment will cover:
* Parallelizing the Caesar Cipher
* The Affine Cipher

## Assignment
There are two parts to this assignment:
* [Part 1](./caesar-revisited/README.md) -- The Caesar Cipher Revisited
* [Part 2](./affine/README.md) -- The Affine Cipher

## Module Learning Objectives
* Recognize types of practical problems that can be parallelized using CUDA
* Understand how many threads are needed to solve a given problem 
* Write kernels that decode messages (using brute force and a formula)
